# TravelOAC
<<<<<<< HEAD

This is the code for the TravelOAC project. Ultimately the code will be published here in a useful, sharable format, but for the moment it is just an easy way to make the code available to others!

Any questions, please email me (n.bearman@liverpool.ac.uk).

There are a number of different files. Here is a brief description, and the rough order they should be used in:
- calc-nearest-stop.R  used to set up OA centriod data and use Routino to calculate routes, and work out nearest stop to each OA population weighted centriod.
- census-data.R reads in various census data and combines with distances
- calc-clusters.R calculate the K-means clustering for the classification
- clustergrams.R code for calculating clustergrams for K-means cluster classification

Additional files:
- routing.R example of routing code
- compare-travel-to-OAC.R splits up travel variables by 2011 OAC

All these files are setup for my computer, and probably won't work out of the box. I hope to tidy this up soon!

Please feel free to fork the repo, and make pull requests.
